## Introduction

Skin cancer classification is a critical step in dermatological diagnosis. Traditional CNNs struggle with:

- Deployment on low-power edge hardware
- Small and imbalanced datasets
- Privacy concerns from cloud-based inference

To overcome these, we design a quantization-aware CNN using Ghost, ECA, and SE modules that seamlessly converts into an SNN optimized for BrainChip Akida neuromorphic chips.

## Methodology

The architecture comprises:

- **Ghost Blocks** for low-cost feature extraction  
- **ECA and SE** for efficient attention and recalibration  
- **Quantized activations** to support CNN-to-SNN conversion  
- **Spike-compatible output head** enabling event-driven deployment  
- **SMOTE + Augmentation** for dataset balancing  
- **Akida MetaTF SDK** for conversion and on-chip learning

The model is trained on traditional GPUs and then ported to SNN via Akida tools.

## Experiments

### Datasets

The HAM10000 dataset is a collection of dermascopic images of common pigmented skin lesions used for training of neural networks for automated diagnosis. It comprises of 10,015 dermatoscopic images sourced from various populations and captured through diverse modalities. It encompasses a comprehensive spectrum of diagnostic categories critical to the study of pigmented lesions. These categories include Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma/Bowen's disease (akiec), basal cell carcinoma (bcc), benign keratosis-like lesions (comprising solar lentigines, seborrheic keratoses, and lichen-planus like keratoses, bkl), dermatofibroma (df), melanoma (mel), melanocytic nevi (nv), and vascular lesions (such as angiomas, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas, and hemorrhage, vasc). This dataset is tailored to aid in the training and development of machine learning models in the field of dermatology.
